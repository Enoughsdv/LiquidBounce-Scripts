Script for RedeSky using LiquidBounce.
- If you have any questions, contact with:
Discord: Enough#7502

- I want to make it clear that these scripts are taken from the LiquidBounce forum and are modified.

Features:
- RedeAuth:
  Tired of having to complete the captcha and register and/or log in to RedeSky?
- RedePhase (NOT FINISHED) :
  I don't recommend using this one, even though it bypasses the anticheat you have to wait a long time to be able to use any other hack or else it cancels it.
